# safetylocker-secure-cloud-upload
Safetylocker is a secure cloud file upload system that I designed and developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and AWS S3. This application allows users to upload files such as images and documents securely with AES-256 encryption before storing them in cloud storage. The system ensures data privacy and protection by encrypting files during upload and decrypting them safely during download.

The project includes a modern responsive user interface, secure backend processing, and seamless integration with AWS cloud storage services. It supports secure file transfer, encrypted storage, and controlled access to files anytime. Through this project, I demonstrated my full stack development skills, cloud integration experience, and ability to build secure real-world web applications using industry-standard security practices.
